\subsection{1-dimensional Random Walk}
Consider $N$ total steps $n_1$ to the right and $n_2$ to the left.
The net displacement to the right is $m = n_1 - n_2$. Since $N = n_1 + n_2$,
we can write $n_1 = (m + N)/2$. Also notice that $\delta m = 2$, since
$m = 2n_1 - N$ and the $m$'s are all separated by 2. 
From the Central Limit Theorem, the 
limiting probability is Gaussian with Probability 
$$P_N(n_1) = {1\over \sigma_N\sqrt{2\pi}} 
\exp\left[-{(n_1 - <n_1>)^2\over2\sigma_N^2}\right],$$
where $\sigma_N^2 = Npq$. If $p = q = 1/2$, then $\sigma_N^2 = N/4$.
In terms of $m$ the 1-dimensional random walk Probability for 
$p = q = 1/2$, becomes
$$P_N(m) = \sqrt{{2\over N\pi}} 
\exp\left[-{m^2\over2N}\right].$$
If each step is of length $l$ then the net displacement is given by
$x = ml$ and since the $m$'s are separated by integral mulitples of $2$
the number of $m$ values in a range of $\delta m = \delta x/2l$.
and the normalized Probability Density in terms of $x$ is given by
$$P_N(x) = {1\over\sqrt{2\pi Nl^2} } 
\exp\left[-{x^2\over2Nl^2}\right].$$
If there are $n$ steps taken uniformly per unit time, then $N = nt$ and
$$P(x,t) = {1\over\sqrt{2\pi nl^2t} } 
\exp\left[-{x^2\over2 nl^2t}\right].$$
The Diffusion constant is normally introduced at this point with the 
constraint that $D = {1\over2} nl^2$ and the Probability Density can then 
be written in terms of the Diffusion Constant as 
$$P(x,t) = {1\over\sqrt{4\pi Dt} } 
\exp\left[-{x^2\over4 Dt}\right].$$


\subsection{$N$-dimensional Random Walk}

The extension of the 1-Dimensional Random Walk to $N$ dimensions
proceeds along similar lines as the above with the resulting final 
Probability Distribution given as 

$$P(x,t) = \left[N\over 2\pi nl^2t \right]^{N\over2}  
\exp\left[-{Nx^2\over2 nl^2t}\right],$$ or

$$P(x,t) = \left[N\over 4\pi Dt] \right]^{N\over2}
\exp\left[-{Nx^2\over 4Dt}\right].$$
