\subsection{First Law of Thermodynamics}

The First Law of Thermodynamics says that the change in internal energy
of a system is equal to the heat energy added to the system  minus the 
work done by the system

$$ dU = dQ - dW.$$

\subsection{Isothermal Expansion of an Ideal Gas}

Ideal Gas Law: $pV = nRT = N_AkT$.

Isothermal Expansion: 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
   dU & = & 0, \\
   dW & = & pdV = nRT {dV\over V}, \\
   dQ & = & dW  = nRT {dV\over V}, \\
   dS & = & {dQ\over T} = nR {dV\over V}. 
  \end{eqnarray*}

By integrating the Entropy for the isothermal expansion we obtain

  $$S_2 - S_1 = n R \ln[V_2/V_1] = N_A k \ln[V_2/V_1].$$
