\section{\underline{Central Potentials}}
Let us know look at the special case where we have spinless particles moving in the presence of a central potential. These central potentials will only depend on the magnitude of $\vec{r}$ (i.e., they are spherically symmetric) and will be denoted by $V(r)$. Introduction of intrinsic spin is straight-forward by is an additional complication which does not give any additional physical insight into the problem -- So we will delay its introduction until later. Furthermore we will only look
at the bound states at this time. 

For a single particle moving in a central potential, the time independent wave equation is
$$H\psi(\vec{r}) = \left( {p^2\over2m}+V(r)\right) \psi(\vec{r}) = E\psi(\vec{r}) \mbox{~~~ or  }$$
$$\left( -{\hbar^2\over2m}\nabla^2 + V(r) - E \right) \psi(\vec{r}) = 0.$$
If we stay in the Cartesian coordinate system, one cannot go much further until $V(r)$ is specified. But because of the spherical symmetry of $V(r)$, it is much more desirale to approach this problem in spherical coordinates. To do this, we
Introduce the orbital angular momentum operator $\ds \vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p}$. In component form, we have $\ds L_x = y p_z - zp_y$ (cyclic). By cyclic, we mean that this formula holds for $x\goes y \goes z \goes x$. Also we have
$[x,p_x] = i\hbar$ (cyclic). With these relations, it is easy to show that 
$$[L_x, L_y] = i\hbar L_z\mbox{~~~(cyclic)}.$$
Symbolically, we can write the three equations implied above as 
$$\vec{L}\times \vec{L} = i\hbar \vec{L}.$$
Using the above commutation relations for the $L_i$'s, one can easily show with 
$$L^2 = L_x^2 + L_y^2 + L_z^2$$ that 
$$[L_x, L^2] = [L_y,L^2] = [L_z,L^2] = 0.$$
In spherical coordinates, one has 
\begin{eqnarray*}
L_x &=& ~i\hbar \left[ \sin\phi {\partial \over \partial \theta} + \cot\theta\cos\phi{\partial \over\partial\phi}\right],\\
L_y &=& -i\hbar \left[ \cos\phi {\partial \over \partial \theta} - \cot\theta\sin\phi{\partial \over\partial\phi}\right],\\
L_z &=& -i\hbar {\partial \over\partial\phi},
\end{eqnarray*}
and 
$$L^2 = -\hbar^2\left[ {1\over\sin\theta} {\partial\over\theta} \sin\theta {\partial\over\partial\theta} + {1\over\sin^2\theta} {\partial^2\over\partial\phi^2} \right].$$

With this expression for $L^2$, one can easily show that in spherical coordinates, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
H = {p^2\over2m} + V(r) &=& -{\hbar^2\over2m}{1\over r}{\partial^2\over \partial r^2} r + {L^2\over2mr^2} + V(r) \\
                                       &=& -{\hbar^2\over2m}{1\over r}{\partial\over\partial r} r^2{\partial\over\partial r} + {L^2\over2mr^2} + V(r)
\end{eqnarray*}
So we see that all the $\theta$ and $\phi$ dependence of our Hamiltonian operator (or of $\nabla^2$) is contained in the operator $L^2$. 

The standard approach to solving 
$$H\psi(\vec{r}) = E\psi(\vec{r})$$ is to assume separable solutions, i.e, 
$$\psi(\vec{r}) = R(r)\Theta(\theta)\Phi(\phi) = R(r)f(\theta, \phi).$$
I will assume that you have already done this in an elementary course in quantum mechanics. What you did and/or found was that one could 
solve for $f(\theta,\phi)$ which was a solution to the differential equation
$$L^2 f(\theta,\phi) = c f(\theta,\phi).$$
The solutions to this differential equation are the spherical harmonics $Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$ which consists of products of associated Legendre 
polynomials and $\ds e^{\pm i m \phi}$'s. The solutions, $Y_{lm}$ have the properties of            
\begin{eqnarray*}
L^2 \Ylm &=& l(l+1)\hbar^2\,\Ylm\mbox{  and}\\
L_z\Ylm  &=& m\hbar\, \Ylm 
\end{eqnarray*}                            
So the $Y_{lm}$'s are simultaneous eigenfunctions of $L^2$ and $L_z$. -- This is okay as $L^2$ and $L_z$ commute. We could have easily looked for 
simultaneous eigenfunctions of $L^2$ and $L_x$ or of $L^2$ and $L_y$. -- But we couldn't look for simultaneous eigenfunctions of $L_y$ and $L_z$ as they don't commute, etc. for $L_x$ and $L_z$ or $L_x$ and $L_y$. 
The eigenfunctions of $L^2$ and $L_x$ or of $L^2$ and $_y$ can always be expanded as $\ds \sum_m\, a_m Y_{lm}$ and these eigenfunctions will still be eigenfunctions of $L^2$. However, it is simpler and conventional
to use the eigenfunctions of $L^2$ and $L_z$, viz., the $Y_{lm}$'s. 

In quantum mechanics, we know that all eigenfunctions are undefined up to an arbitrary phase, Recent quantum mechanical texts usually adopt what is known as the ``Condon and Shortley'' phases for the $Y_{lm}$'s and we will 
do this also. A word of caution however, all texts and/or articles do not necessarily do so -- see Pauling \& Wilson, 1st edition of Schiff. The phases when we adopt fo the $Y_{lm}$'s are
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y^*_{l,m}(\theta,\phi) &=& (-1)^m\, Y_{l,-m}(\theta,\phi) \mbox{ ~~~~ with} \\
\Ylm &=& (-1)^m \sqrt{(2l+1)(l-|m)! \over 4\pi(l+|m|)!}  \, P_l^{|m|}(\cos\theta)e^{im\phi}.
\end{eqnarray*}
The $Y^*_{lm}$'s and $\Ylm$'s are orthonormal such that 
\[ \int\, Y^*_{lm}(\theta,\phi) Y_{l'm'}(\theta,\phi)\, \sin\theta\, d\theta d\phi  \ = \int \, Y^*_{l'm'}(\Omega)Y_{l'm'}(\Omega)\, d\Omega = \delta_{ll'} \delta_{mm'} \]
where $d\Omega \equiv \sin\theta \, d\theta d\phi $ = differential element of solid angle. (See Schiff pp. 76-83 for more details).

With this digression dealing with the spherical harmonics, $\Ylm$, which by the way form a complete set in $\theta, \phi$ space, let us now return to our central potential problem with 
\[ H = {p^2\over2m} = -{\hbar^2\over2m} {1\over r} {\partial^2 \over \partial r^2} + {L^2\over2mr^2} + V(r). \]
Instead of solving $\ds H \psi(\vec{r}) = E\psi(\vec{r})$ using separable solutions, we note that the $\Ylm$'s form a complete set and so we expand $\psi(\vec{r})$ in terms of them, viz.,
\[ \psi(\vec{r}) = \sum_{l',m'} \, R_{l'm'} Y_{l'm'}(\theta, \phi). \]
Since $L^2 Y_{l'm'} = l'(l'+1)\hbar^2 Y_{\l'm'}$, our differential 
equation becomes
\[ \sum_{l'm'}\, \left[ {1\over r} {\partial^2\over \partial r^2} r - {l'(l'+1)\over r^2} + {2m\over\hbar^2}(E - V(r))\right] R_{l'm'}Y_{l'm'} = 0 \]
Multiplying by $Y^*_{lm}(\theta,\phi)$ and integrating over $\theta$ and $\phi$, the orthogonality of the $\Ylm$'s give us
\[ \left[ {1\over r} {\partial^2\over \partial r^2} r  -{l(l+1)\over r^2} + {2m\over\hbar^2}(E - V(r))\right] R_{lm}(r) = 0 \] which is the differential equation which we must solve for $R_{lm}(r)$, the radial solutions. 

For a central potential, $V(r)$, the ``magnetic quantum number'', $m$, does not enter -- the $m$ in $\ds {2m\over\hbar^2}$ is the mass -- and so we can drop the subscript $m$ on $R_{lm}(r)$ and write it simple as $R_l(r)$.

In the more general case where $V(\vec{r})$ is not spherically symmetric, $R_{lm}(r)$ will depend on $m$ and we will have to retain it in our solution.

If our particles have intrinsic spin, $\vec(s)$, the only change will be to replace $\Ylm$ above by $\Ylm \chi_{sm_s}$ where $X_{sm_s}$ are eigenfunctions of the spin operator. -- We will do this in more detail later. 

In order to proceed further, we need to now the form of $V(r)$. We will now look at three rather common cases -- The square well, the hydrogen atom, and the three dimensional harmonic oscillator. I will assume that you 
have already done these three cases before. I will only summarize them and let you fill in the details.

\subsection{\underline{Square Well (Bound State}}
For a square well, we have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V(r) &=& - V_0\mbox{~~~ for ~} 0\le r \le a \\
V(r) &=& 0 \mbox{~~~~ for ~} r > a
\end{eqnarray*}
We define 
\begin{eqnarray*}
K &=&  \sqrt{ {2m\over\hbar^2} )V_0 - |E| } \mbox{ and } \rho = Kr \mbox{ for } r\le a \\
k &=& \sqrt{{2m|E|\over\hbar^2}}\mbox{  and  } \rho = ikr \mbox{ for } r>a
\end{eqnarray*}
For $r\le a$ and $\rho = Ka$, our differential equation becomes 
\[ {d^2R_l(\rho)\over d\rho^2} + {2\over\rho} {dR_l(\rho)\over d\rho} + \left[ 1- {l(l+1)\over\rho^2}   \right]\, R_l(\rho) = 0. \]
The solutions to this differential equation are the spherical Bessel functions $j_l(\rho)$ and $n_l(\rho)$ where 
\begin{eqnarray*}
k_l(\rho) &=& \sqrt{\pi\over2\rho} J_{l+\half} (\rho) \mbox{ and is regular at the origin and }\\
n_l(\rho) &=& (-1)^{l+1} \sqrt{\pi\over2\rho} J_{-(l+\half)}(\rho) \mbox{ and is irregular at the origin}.
\end{eqnarray*}

Since $n_l(\rho)$ is irregular at the origin, it must be excluded in the solution $R_l(\rho)$ for $r\le a$. Then $R_l(\rho) \propto j_l(\rho)$ for $r \le a$. 

The asymptotic properties of $j_l$ and $n_l$ which we will use quite often are
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{\rho\goes 0} j_l(\rho) &\goes& {\rho^l\over (2l+1)!!}, ~~~~~~ \lim_{\rho\goes\infty} j_l(\rho) \goes {\cos[ \rho-(l+1){\pi\over2}]\over \rho}, \\
\lim_{\rho\goes 0} n_l(\rho) &\goes& {(2l-1)!!\over\rho^{l+1}}, ~~~~~~ \lim_{\rho\goes\infty} n_l(\rho) \goes {\sin[ \rho-(l+1){\pi\over2}]\over \rho}.
\end{eqnarray*}
where $(2l+1)!! \equiv (2l+1)(2l-1)(2l-3)\hdots5\cdot3\cdot1$.

In the ``exterior'' region where $r\ge a$, we have the same differential equation for $R_l(\rho)$ with $\rho = i k r$. Since the origin is now excluded we can expect that $R_l(\rho)$ will be in general a linear combination of $j_l$ and $n_l$. 
Normally it is more convenient to use instead the spherical Hankel functions $h^{(1)}_l(\rho)$ and $h^{(2)}(\rho)$ where 
\begin{eqnarray*}
h^{(1)}_l(\rho) &\equiv& j_l(\rho) + i  n_l(\rho) \mbox{  ~~ and }\\
h^{(2)}_l(\rho) &\equiv& j_l(\rho) - i  n_l(\rho),\\
\end{eqnarray*}
which have asymptotic behaviors of 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{\rho\goes\infty} h^{(1)}_l(\rho) &\goes& {e^{i[\rho-(l+1) {\pi\over2} ]} \over \rho} \mbox{  ~~ and }\\
\lim_{\rho\goes\infty} h^{(2)}_l(\rho) &\goes& {e^{-i[\rho-(l+1){\pi\over2} ]} \over \rho}.
\end{eqnarray*}

For our case of a square well, $\rho = -ikr$ and we see that the Hankel functions will describe increasing and decreasing exponentials in the asymptotic region where $rho \goes \infty$. Clearly, the increasing exponential will not be 
allowed for the bound states. 

Furthermore, our solutions, and their derivatives must be continuous across the ``boundary'' at $r = a$. Not every value of $E$ will satisfy this ``matching requirement''. As a result, only certain discrete values of $E$ will be 
allowed for bound states. Practically all quantum mechanics texts work out these solutions and I refer you to them for details. 

For an infinitely deep square well, the energy levels look somewhat like those shown at the right
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{graph_a}
\caption{Infinite Square Well Energy Eigenvalues}
\label{fig:InfiniteSquareWell}
\end{figure}
Instead of labeling of the levels by $l = 0,1,2,3,\hdots$, one uses $s, p, d, f, g, h, i, \hdots$ respectively. The lowest $s$ levels is the $1s$ level, the next is the $2s$ level, etc.

This is one of the two most common labelling schemes. Another labeling scheme will be used for the Hydrogen atom which we will discuss next. 

\subsection{\underline{Hydrogen Atom (without spin)}}
Now we have a two-body problem but we will show that it reduces to a one-body problem. Our Hamiltonian is 
\[ H = {p_1^2\over2m_1} + {p_2^2\over2m_2} + V(|\vec{r_1} - \vec{r_2})|) \equiv E_{total} \] where one particle is an electron, the other is a proton, and
$\ds V(|\vec{r_1} - \vec{r_2})|)$ is the Coulomb potential between them. We now transform to the relative and center of mass coordinate using 
\[ \vec{r} = \vec{r_1} - \vec{r_2}, \quad \vec{R} = {m_1 \vec{r_1} + m_2\vec{r_2}\over m_1 + m_2}, \quad M = m_1 + m_2, \mbox{  and} \]
\[ m = {m_1m_2\over m_1 + m_2} ~~= \mbox{  reduced mass}.\]
This transformation gives 
\[ H = {P^2\over2M} + {p^2\over2m} + V(r), \mbox{~~where~~} \vec{P} = M\dot{\vec{R}}, \mbox{ ~ and ~} \vec{p} = m{\dot\vec{r}}. \]
We see that the Hamiltonian separates into two parts and so we can seek a separable solution 
$$\psi(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_r}) = \psi_{CM}(\vec{R}) \psi(\vec{r}).$$ 
The differential equation for $\psi_{CM}(\vec{R})$ is
$${P^2\over2M} \psi_{CM}(\vec{R}) = E_{CM} \psi_{CM}(\vec{R})$$ where $\ds E_{total} \equiv E_{CM} + E$.

This differential equation has the solution \[ \psi_{CM}({\vec R}) = A e^{ikR} + B e^{-ikR} \] where $\ds k^2 = {2mE_{CM}\over \hbar^2}$. These solutions are plane wave solutions which represent the center of mass of the system moving
with a constant velocity. Now we are not interested in this center of mass motion and will study the case where the center of mass is a rest. Or we could transform to the reference frame where the center of mass is at rest. 
Either way is okay as there is not interesting physics in this center of mass motion. 

Consequently, we are left with a differential equation of $\psi({\vec r})$ to solve of \[ \left[{p^2\over 2m} + V(r)\right] \, \psi({\vec r}) = E \psi({\vec r}).\]
Thus we see that all two body problems with an interaction depending only on their relative distance will reduce to an equivalent problem of a single particle moving in a central potential $V(r)$. It is equivalent to the case where
the heavier particle, the proton here, is ``fixed'' at the origin and the other particle moves in the potential $V(r)$ with a reduced mass \[ m = {m_1 m_2\over m_1 + m_2}.\]
